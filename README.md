# Thiscord
a crappy port of the discord interface front-end shit, maybe good for archival purposes i dont know

live version available on http://thiscord.evolutionevotv.pl/</br>
</br>
currently most of the crap is pointing at my domain so if you feel like it or you have to you can change it, this pointer stuff is in most if not all the HTML files.

# some info
i feel like i have to put this out there, just to make it clear.</br>
</br>
we, nor our site is affiliated with Discord itself. This project serves archival & educational purposes, all credit for the original sources (ui, logos, icons, etc.) goes to them.

# stuff worth mentioning
this isn't supposed to function like Discord at all, some stuff may work purely to test out things. or just add a little more spicyness to the project</br>
no, we won't add sending messages. no, we won't add anything else related to the functionality of discord.</br>
</br>
this is just intended to rip off the Discord UI, not Discord itself as a whole.
